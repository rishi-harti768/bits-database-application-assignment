Your task is to build a Spring Boot application to manage information for any two entities of your choice (e.g., Books and Authors, Students and Courses). You are required to implement three operations: creating, reading, and updating data for these entities.

### Operations

1. Populate Database:

- Once the entities are identified, create the required tables in the database using JPA and populate all the tables with sample data (10 rows in each table).

2. Create Operation:

- Implement a form in a JSP page to add entities.

- Create a controller method to handle the form submission and save the new entities.

- Handle exceptions in case of any integrity violations.

3. Read Operation:

- Implement a view in JSP that displays a list of all entities.

- Create a controller method that fetches data from the service layer and binds it to the JSP view.

- Implement a custom query method in the repository layer that performs an inner join between both entities and returns the result.

4. Update Operation:

- Implement functionality to update the details of existing entities.

- Create a controller method to handle the update request and save the updated data to the database.

### Requirements:

- Entity Classes:
  - Define the entities, their attributes, and relationships using JPA annotations like @Entity, @Id, @OneToMany, etc., to define relationships and other constraints.

- Repository Layer:
  - Create repository interfaces for the entities, extending JpaRepository.
  - Include custom query methods as mentioned.

- Service Layer:
  - Implement service classes to handle business logic.
  - Ensure proper integration with the repository layer.

- Controller Layer:
  - Implement Spring MVC controllers for handling HTTP requests related to the entities.
  - Ensure proper data binding between the model and the view using JSTL or Expression Language (EL).

- View Layer:
  - Create JSP pages to display the form for adding entities, listing entities, and updating existing entity details.
  - Apply CSS styles to make the JSP pages visually appealing.

- Testing:
  - Write unit tests for your repository and service methods using frameworks like JUnit and Mockito.
  - Test the application by performing create, read, and update operations via the web interface.

### Submission Requirements:

A PDF document explaining your approach, including:

- Entity relationship design,
- Implementation details for each operation (Code and screenshots),
- Challenges faced and how you overcame them,
- Github URL of the project.
